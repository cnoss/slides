  CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. 
  
  Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time. With CSS transitions enabled, changes occur at time intervals that follow an acceleration curve, all of which can be customized.
codeExample1: |
  div {
    transition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>;
  }

  /**/
  div {
    transition: 
      <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>, 
      <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>;
  }
codeExample2: |
  a{
    transition: background-color 1s ease-in-out 0s;
    background-color: orange;
    /**/
    &:hover{
      background-color: #dd1166;
    }
  }
