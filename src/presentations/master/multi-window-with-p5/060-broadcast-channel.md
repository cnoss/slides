  The window.postMessage() method safely enables cross-origin communication between Window objects; e.g., between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it. The Broadcast Channel API is restricted on same origin communication.

  If a participant (tab, window, worker) sends a message via BroadcastChannel.postMessage(), it is sent to all other participants in the channel - but not to the sender itself. 

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that window.postMessage() also works without the Broadcast Channel API.

vorteile: |
  - combines broadcasting and direct messaging
  - works well for decoupled, event-based communication
  - no shared memory needed ‚Äî everything flows through messages
  - no direct window references needed
  - scalable to multiple tabs and controlled windows

nachteile: |
  - requires same-origin (for BroadcastChannel)
  - no built-in state ‚Äî messages must be actively passed around
  - no message history ‚Äî late listeners miss earlier messages
