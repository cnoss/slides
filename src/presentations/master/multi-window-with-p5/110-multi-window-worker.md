  This [SharedWorker](https://cnoss.github.io/multi-window-experiences/00-core-concepts/shared-worker-with-central-state-management-demo/index.html) script manages real-time communication between multiple browser windows by tracking and sharing their screen positions. 
  
  Each connected window can send its current position, retrieve its own stored position, or request the positions of all other connected windows.
