  p5.js is an open-source JavaScript library that brings the core principles of creative coding to the web. It was initiated in 2013 by Lauren McCarthy, an artist and programmer, as a browser-based reinterpretation of Processing, the influential visual programming environment developed by Casey Reas and Ben Fry at the MIT Media Lab.
