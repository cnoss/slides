  The View Transitions API provides a mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different website views. This includes animating between DOM states in a single-page app (SPA), and <span class="fragment">**animating the navigation between documents in a multi-page app (MPA)**.</span><span class="fragment">üï∫üèºüôåüèΩ</span>

  <span class="fragment">View transitions are a popular design choice for reducing users' cognitive load, helping them stay in context, and reducing perceived loading latency as they move between states or views of an application.</span>

codeExample1: |
  <meta name="view-transition" content="same-origin" />

codeExampleStep2: |
  @view-transition {
    navigation: auto; // [auto |¬†none]
  }

codeExampleStep3: |
  @keyframes move-out {
    from {
      transform: translateY(0%);
    }
    to {
      transform: translateY(-100%);
    }
  }
  /**/
  @keyframes move-in {
    from {
      transform: translateY(100%);
    }
    to {
      transform: translateY(0%);
    }
  }

codeExampleStep4: |
  ::view-transition-old(root) {
    animation-name: move-out;
    animation-duration: 0.4s;
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
    animation-direction: both;
  }
  /**/
  ::view-transition-new(root) {
    animation: 0.4s ease-in both move-in;
  }
